# getWindowsSpotlightWallpapers

This is a powershell script to copy Windows Spotlight Wallpaper to your desired folder and rename the files so that they can be used as Images.
By default the wallpapers do not have an extension and this script copies only the wallapers files to a location you desire and then add the .jpg extension.
It also deletes any duplicate files that may be present as already.

In the $path varibale please substitute the username as your user in your c:\users folder. Please remove the angle brackets(<>) in the path.
Also, please use a desired folder as the destination for copying the files. Do not remove the double quotes in the destination. Right click on the file and click run with PowerShell.

Enjoy!
