# getWindowsSpotlightWallpapers

This is a powershell script to copy Windows Spotlight Wallpaper to your desired folder and rename the files so that they can be used as Images.
By default the wallpapers do not have an extension and this script copies only the wallapers files to a location you desire and then add the .jpg extension.
It also deletes any duplicate files that may have gotten copies as part of the process.

Enjoy!
